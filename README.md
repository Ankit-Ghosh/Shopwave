Shopwave is a full-stack e-commerce platform designed to streamline the process of setting up and managing online stores. It provides a user-friendly interface for both customers and administrators, offering features such as product browsing, cart management, and order tracking.

## Features

- **Frontend:** The frontend of the application is built using React.js and styled with CSS. It provides a responsive and intuitive user interface for customers to browse products, add items to their cart, and complete purchases.
- **Backend:** The backend of the application is developed with Node.js and Express.js. It handles authentication, product management, order processing, and other server-side functionalities.
- **Database:** MongoDB is used as the database to store product information, user data, and order details. Mongoose.js is utilized for object modeling and data manipulation.
